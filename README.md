# Parabola Macro

![PHOTO OF PARABOLIC TOOLPATHS](/IMG_0626.jpg "DEMO")

## Overview
Function that uses current tool position and arguments to make parabolic shapes out of round stock in Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) lathes.  The code is EIA-ISO, known to machinists as [G Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code).

## Features
- Usage is similar as the G71 canned cycle, but with parabola specific arguments.
- Position the parabola with the X and Z arguments anywhere in your tool envelope.
- Specify a sub section of the parabola with the A and B arguments for beginning Z and final Z coordinate.  If B > A, the parabola will open in the Z- direction.  A < B the parabola will open in the Z+ direction.
- Scale the parabola in the X direction with the C argument.  Negative value for C will cause the curve to move in the X- direction.
